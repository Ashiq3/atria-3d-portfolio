## Pending Tasks (Require Manual Intervention)

The following tasks require manual intervention as they involve creating resources on GitHub through the web interface:

1. **Set up branch protection rules**
   - Configure branch protection rules for the "main" branch

2. **Configure repository secrets**
   - Set up repository secrets for AWS deployment credentials

3. **Create project board**
   - Create a GitHub project board with columns: Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Review, Done

4. **Add team members**
   - Add team members with appropriate permissions to the repository

## Automated Setup Option

If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can use the provided scripts to automate most of the setup:

### Windows:
```bash
scripts\setup-github.bat
```

### macOS/Linux:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/setup-github.sh
./scripts/setup-github.sh
```

Note: These scripts will help with repository creation and initial setup, but you'll still need to manually configure secrets, branch protection rules, project boards, and team members.

## Manual Setup Option

If GitHub CLI is not available, follow the detailed manual setup instructions in `docs/project/GITHUB_MANUAL_SETUP.md`.

## Troubleshooting

Refer to the troubleshooting section in `docs/project/GITHUB_MANUAL_SETUP.md` for solutions to common issues.

## Summary

The local repository has been successfully pushed to GitHub. All necessary workflows, documentation, and scripts have been created. The remaining tasks require manual intervention through the GitHub web interface or additional tools.
