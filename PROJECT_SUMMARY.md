- **Material Swatches**: Six premium materials including liquid glass, brushed platinum, and crystalline surfaces
- **Typography**: Canela Text for display, Neue Haas Grotesk for UI
- **Motion Design**: 60fps animations with inertia scroll and magnet cursor effects

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Primary**: Three.js r163 with WebGPU renderer
- **Fallback**: WebGL2 renderer for broader compatibility
- **Optimization**: Google Draco compression and custom Meshopt
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Performance Targets
- **Load Time**: ≤ 1.5 seconds on fiber/5G
- **Frame Rate**: 60 FPS on high-end devices, 30 FPS fallback on mobile
- **Memory Usage**: ≤ 512 MB GPU memory
- **Initial Load**: ≤ 1.2 MB critical path

### Hosting Strategy
- **CDN**: AWS CloudFront with global edge locations
- **Storage**: S3 Intelligent-Tiering for cost optimization
- **Security**: SSL/TLS, DDoS protection, and strict CSP
- **Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

## 3D Experience Design

### Hero Sequence
A 120-frame (2-second) cinematic animation featuring:
1. Obsidian prism suspended in darkness
2. Fracture into 10,000 floating glass shards
3. Shards orbit and coalesce into ATRIA monogram
4. Monogram melts into floor revealing gallery corridor

### Project Showcase
- **Count**: 6 flagship projects
- **Media**: 12-second 8K cinemagraphs + interactive 3D models
- **Navigation**: Scroll-based or touch gesture controlled
- **Detail**: Photogrammetry-based models with PBR materials

### Micro-Interactions
- **Magnet Cursor**: Platinum halo effect
- **Glass-Morph**: Blur transitions on hover
- **Inertia Scroll**: 1.8× multiplier for cinematic feel
- **Sound Design**: Subtle crystalline chimes on transitions

## Accessibility & Inclusivity

### WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance
- **Screen Reader**: Alt-3D JSON descriptors for all elements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full site functionality without mouse
- **Reduced Motion**: Static alternatives for animations
- **Color Contrast**: ≥ 4.5:1 for all text elements

### Device Support
- **Primary**: 5K iMac, 14" MacBook Pro, iPad Pro 12.9", Galaxy S24 Ultra
- **Secondary**: All modern browsers with WebGL support
- **Performance**: Graceful degradation on lower-end devices

## Content Strategy

### Project Presentation
Each of the 6 projects will feature:
- Interactive 3D model (≤ 2 MB)
- 12-second looping cinemagraph
- Project description and specifications
- Material and process documentation

### Storytelling Elements
- **Narrative Flow**: Guided tour through light-filled spaces
- **Information Hierarchy**: Progressive disclosure of details
- **Emotional Journey**: From darkness to illumination
- **Brand Integration**: Consistent visual language throughout

## Production Pipeline

### Asset Creation
1. **On-site Photography**: 100 MP RAW stills + LiDAR scanning
2. **3D Modeling**: Blender with photogrammetry reconstruction
3. **Texturing**: Substance Painter with PBR workflow
4. **Optimization**: Draco compression and Meshopt reduction

### Quality Assurance
- **Visual Inspection**: Comparison to reference materials
- **Technical Review**: Polygon counts and texture resolutions
- **Performance Testing**: Load times and frame rates
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Verification on all target devices

## Digital Ownership

### NFT Certificate
- **Token**: ERC-721 "ATRIA GENESIS" on Ethereum
- **Metadata**: SHA-256 hash of final site build
- **Assets**: 3D model, animated GIF, and video preview
- **Hosting**: IPFS with Pinata for decentralized storage

## Marketing & Distribution

### Social Media Presence
- **Instagram Teaser**: 9:16 vertical site with looping videos
- **Content Strategy**: Behind-the-scenes, process shots, final reveals
- **Community Engagement**: Web3 and design communities
- **Launch Campaign**: Coordinated announcement across channels

### Analytics & Monitoring
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals and custom 3D metrics
- **User Behavior**: Heatmaps and session recordings
- **Business Metrics**: Traffic, engagement, and conversion tracking
- **Technical Monitoring**: Uptime, errors, and resource usage

## Timeline & Milestones

### 12-Week Sprint
1. **Week 1**: Creative lock and technical setup
2. **Weeks 2-3**: 8K shoots and LiDAR scanning
3. **Weeks 4-5**: 3D asset production
4. **Week 6**: Asset optimization
5. **Weeks 7-8**: Frontend development (hero + 3 case studies)
6. **Week 10**: Accessibility and performance audit
7. **Week 11**: Soft preview for stakeholders
8. **Week 12**: Final case studies and polish
9. **Week 13**: NFT minting and social teaser drop
10. **Week 14**: Public launch

## Budget Considerations

### Development Costs
- **Creative & Technical**: $1,000,000 (as specified)
