# Next Steps for GitHub Repository Setup

This document provides clear, actionable steps to complete the GitHub repository setup for the ATRIA 3D Portfolio website. Since GitHub CLI is not installed on this system, you'll need to perform these steps manually through the GitHub web interface.

## Overview

The following tasks need to be completed to fully set up your GitHub repository:

1. Create a private GitHub repository
2. Push your local code to GitHub
3. Configure branch protection rules
4. Set up repository secrets for deployment
5. Create a project board for task management
6. Add team members to the repository

## Detailed Instructions

### 1. Create Private GitHub Repository

1. Navigate to https://github.com/new (you must be logged into GitHub)
2. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `atria-3d-portfolio`
   - **Description**: "ATRIA 3D Portfolio Website - An immersive 3D portfolio showcasing creative works using WebGPU and Three.js"
   - **Visibility**: Select "Private"
   - **Important**: Leave all initialization options unchecked (no README, no .gitignore, no license)
3. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Local Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, you'll need to connect your local repository to the remote one:

1. Open a terminal in your project directory (`c:/Users/Ashiqe/Desktop/3d web using kimi`)
2. Add the remote origin (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username):
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/atria-3d-portfolio.git
   ```
3. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### 3. Configure Branch Protection Rules

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click "Branches"
4. Under "Branch protection rules", click "Add rule"
5. In the "Branch name pattern" field, enter `main`
6. Check the following options:
   - "Require pull request reviews before merging"
   - "Require status checks to pass before merging"
   - "Include administrators" (recommended)
7. Click "Create"

### 4. Set Up Repository Secrets

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret" and add each of the following:
   - Name: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, Value: Your AWS access key ID
   - Name: `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, Value: Your AWS secret access key
   - Name: `S3_BUCKET_NAME`, Value: Your S3 bucket name
   - Name: `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID`, Value: Your CloudFront distribution ID

### 5. Create Project Board

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the "Projects" tab
3. Click "New project"
4. Select the "Basic kanban" template
5. Name the project "ATRIA 3D Portfolio"
6. Click "Create project"
7. Verify that the board has the following columns:
   - Backlog
   - Todo
   - In Progress
   - Review
   - Done

### 6. Add Team Members

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click "Collaborators and teams"
4. Click "Add people"
5. Enter the GitHub usernames or email addresses of team members
6. Select appropriate permissions:
   - Developers: "Write" or "Maintain"
   - Project managers: "Maintain" or "Admin"
   - Stakeholders: "Read"

## Verification

After completing all steps, verify that:

1. ✅ Code is visible in your GitHub repository
2. ✅ Branch protection rules are active (try making a direct commit to test)
3. ✅ Repository secrets are configured (check in Settings → Secrets)
4. ✅ Project board is created with all required columns
5. ✅ Team members have appropriate access (they should receive invitations)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Permission denied" when pushing code**
   - Solution: Ensure you're using the correct credentials. Try using SSH instead:
     ```bash
     git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/atria-3d-portfolio.git
     ```

2. **Branch protection rules not working**
   - Solution: Verify you're targeting the correct branch name ("main") and that required status checks are properly configured.

3. **Repository secrets not accessible in workflows**
   - Solution: Ensure secrets are named exactly as referenced in workflow files and that workflows have proper permissions.

## Next Steps After Repository Setup

1. Test the CI/CD pipeline by making a small change and creating a pull request
2. Configure automated deployments using the AWS secrets you've set up
3. Begin populating your project board with tasks from `TASK_LIST.md`
4. Set up any additional webhooks or notifications as needed

## Support

If you encounter issues during setup:

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Refer to GitHub's official documentation
3. Review the detailed instructions in `docs/project/GITHUB_MANUAL_SETUP.md`
4. Consult with your team or project manager

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit secrets or credentials to the repository
- Regularly review repository access permissions
- Keep branch protection rules enabled
- Monitor deployment workflows for unauthorized changes
