## Pending Tasks (Require Manual Intervention)

The following tasks require manual intervention as they involve creating resources on GitHub. Detailed instructions are available in `docs/project/GITHUB_MANUAL_SETUP.md`:

1. **Push repository to GitHub**
   - Create a new private repository named "atria-3d-portfolio" on GitHub
   - Add the remote origin to the local repository
   - Push the code to GitHub

2. **Set up branch protection rules**
   - Configure branch protection rules for the "main" branch

3. **Configure repository secrets**
   - Set up repository secrets for AWS deployment credentials

4. **Create project board**
   - Create a GitHub project board with columns: Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Review, Done

5. **Add team members**
   - Add team members with appropriate permissions to the repository

## Automated Setup Option

If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can use the provided scripts to automate most of the setup:

### Windows:
```bash
scripts\setup-github.bat
```

### macOS/Linux:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/setup-github.sh
./scripts/setup-github.sh
```

Note: These scripts will help with repository creation and initial setup, but you'll still need to manually configure secrets, branch protection rules, project boards, and team members.

## Manual Setup Option

If GitHub CLI is not available, follow the detailed manual setup instructions in `docs/project/GITHUB_MANUAL_SETUP.md`.

## Summary

The local repository is fully configured and ready to be pushed to GitHub. All necessary workflows, documentation, and scripts have been created. The remaining tasks require manual intervention through the GitHub web interface or additional tools.
