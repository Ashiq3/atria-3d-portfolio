# Repository Setup Summary

This document summarizes the progress made on setting up the GitHub repository for the ATRIA 3D Portfolio website.

## Completed Tasks

### Local Repository Setup
- ✅ Initialized local Git repository
- ✅ Configured Git user settings
- ✅ Added all project files to the repository
- ✅ Made initial commit with project files

### GitHub Repository Creation
- ✅ Created private GitHub repository named "atria-3d-portfolio"
- ✅ Pushed local code to GitHub repository

### GitHub Actions Configuration
- ✅ Created CI workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- ✅ Configured automated testing on multiple Node.js versions
- ✅ Set up build validation process

### Documentation
- ✅ Updated README.md with GitHub repository setup instructions
- ✅ Created deployment documentation in `docs/technical/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- ✅ Added setup scripts for both Windows and Unix-like systems
- ✅ Enhanced manual setup instructions in `docs/project/GITHUB_MANUAL_SETUP.md`
- ✅ Created comprehensive next steps guide in `docs/project/NEXT_STEPS.md`

### License
- ✅ Added MIT License file

## Pending Tasks

### Branch Protection
- ⏳ Set up branch protection rules for main branch

### Repository Configuration
- ⏳ Set up repository secrets for deployment credentials
- ⏳ Create project board with columns: Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Review, Done
- ⏳ Add team members with appropriate permissions

## Next Steps

1. Follow the manual setup instructions in `docs/project/NEXT_STEPS.md`
2. Configure branch protection rules
3. Set up repository secrets for AWS deployment
4. Create GitHub project board
5. Add team members to the repository

## Setup Scripts

The following scripts are provided to automate the GitHub repository setup:

- Windows: `scripts/setup-github.bat`
- macOS/Linux: `scripts/setup-github.sh`

These scripts require the GitHub CLI to be installed and configured. If GitHub CLI is not available, follow the manual setup instructions in `docs/project/GITHUB_MANUAL_SETUP.md`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the setup process, refer to the troubleshooting section in `docs/project/GITHUB_MANUAL_SETUP.md` for common solutions.

## Repository Structure

The repository follows a modern web development structure with:

- `src/` - Source code for the 3D portfolio
- `docs/` - Documentation and project resources
- `scripts/` - Automation scripts
- `.github/workflows/` - GitHub Actions workflows
- `tests/` - Unit and end-to-end tests

## Security Considerations

- Repository secrets should never be committed to the repository
- Branch protection rules help maintain code quality
- Regular security audits should be performed
