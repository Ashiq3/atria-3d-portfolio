## Pending Tasks (Require Manual Intervention)

### GitHub Repository Creation
The following tasks require manual intervention as they involve creating resources on GitHub:

1. **Create private repository on GitHub**
   - Log in to GitHub
   - Create a new private repository named "atria-3d-portfolio"
   - Add the remote origin to the local repository:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/atria-3d-portfolio.git
     ```
   - Push the code to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin main
     ```

2. **Set up branch protection rules**
   - Go to repository Settings > Branches
   - Add rule for "main" branch with appropriate protection settings

3. **Configure repository secrets**
   - Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
   - Add the following secrets for AWS deployment:
     - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
     - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
     - S3_BUCKET_NAME
     - CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID

4. **Create project board**
   - Go to Projects tab
   - Create a new project board with columns: Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Review, Done

5. **Add team members**
   - Go to Settings > Collaborators and teams
   - Add team members with appropriate permissions

## Automated Setup Option

If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can use the provided scripts to automate most of the setup:

### Windows:
```bash
scripts\setup-github.bat
```

### macOS/Linux:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/setup-github.sh
./scripts/setup-github.sh
```

Note: These scripts will help with repository creation and initial setup, but you'll still need to manually configure secrets, branch protection rules, project boards, and team members.

## Summary

The local repository is fully configured and ready to be pushed to GitHub. All necessary workflows, documentation, and scripts have been created. The remaining tasks require manual intervention through the GitHub web interface or additional tools.
